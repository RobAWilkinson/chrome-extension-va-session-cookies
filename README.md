# VA.gov session cookies Chrome extension

## The Problem

When testing VA.gov user API endpoints (such as `GET v0/user` and `POST v0/notifications/dismissed_statuses`) in Postman, you need to send the `api_session` and `vagov_session_dev` cookies with any request. You do this by creating a single header named `Cookie` to pass along the value of those cookies.

An example of the value for the `Cookie` header would be:

```text
api_session=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--068924b4abb306a7eb1b0138477b740c70f1dc68; vagov_session_dev=fzdVGr0CT1FgDv_SxjWQty1LfIF5Vgcmj9OgWC-VFx6Liyt8YkrIgjCr6NFFx__Snv9DRG61DNIRwjot-JpA6sT2S1xP17YgD4mmKI9r5XX8x4lzZp0U5LtoBBfSHRqlOlWQmVFbIEc4aQP8kxhv7o91Duu997raWNyKizUmCoVJ-H_wVWCQI-tdn48jPyNT0Wi-Y-Cq-EbFtcfDDQX0LVqpTlTaIPd_QgjuY9v1Kn96p0EcBQwJzjFv28hv9KEx
```

Because valid values change whenever you sign in, updating the `Cookie` header is a pain; you need to copy the current cookie values from the web inspector and paste them into the long string show above. This is slow, tedious, and error-prone. Mostly slow. And oh so tedious.

## The Solution

This Chrome extension aims to make updating the `Cookie` header in Postman easier. Once you are signed into VA.gov, click on the extension's icon. This will copy the current cookie values to your clipboard. Then, in Postman, paste the clipboard contents into the value of the `Cookie` header. Voil√†! You can now make user-authenticated requests in Postman.

## Installation

First, clone this repo to someplace on your computer.

Then install it in Chrome as an "unpacked extension"[^1]:

1. Open the Extension Management page by navigating to `chrome://extensions`.
2. Enable Developer Mode by clicking the toggle switch next to Developer mode.
3. Click the LOAD UNPACKED button and select the extension directory (where you cloned this repo to on your computer).

## Notes

- I've only tested this when running the VA.gov site locally.
- I've never made a Chrome extension and have no idea what I'm doing.
- I wanted to make this a single-click operation that didn't require a popup menu. But since I'm relying on the `navigator.clipboard` API, I need to embed the relevant code into a popup HTML page :(
- Now that I've done this, I wonder if Chrome has a command-line API that would let me grab the cookies so that this could be done in a shell script.
